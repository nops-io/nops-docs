## IAM Policy Permissions for the nOps Platform ##
Currently, the AWS managed `ReadOnlyAccess` policy is attached to the role created by `nOps`. This is to take advantage of a continuously updated managed policy that will cover
future services added into AWS that the `nOps` platform can add without customer intervention. However, customers requiring a more restricted environment for security concerns may
deny access to some services or actions. The following table shows the base permissions requested for the `nOps` free platform to provide recommendations around cost, security and
general architecture best practices.

| Base Permissions Requested                                 | Purpose                                                                                     | Optimization Platform Use                                                                                                            |
