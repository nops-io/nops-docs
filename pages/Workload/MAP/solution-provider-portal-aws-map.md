# **AWS MAP on Solutions Provider Portal**

- TOC
{:toc}

## How to track all your clients’ MAP projects in one place with nOps

**The AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)** is designed to support cloud transitions with migration tools and financial incentives, such as AWS credits, to help reduce costs. MAP guides businesses through cloud migration and optimization, focusing on tagging and tracking AWS spending to fully leverage credits.

Tracking AWS MAP progress is crucial for getting these benefits. MAP Solutions Providers play a key role, helping clients plan and manage migrations using MAP tools.

**nOps AWS MAP Manager:**

nOps simplifies tracking across clients’ projects. The MAP Dashboard in nOps allows Solutions Providers to:

- **Optimize Costs**: Track tagged vs. untagged resources to ensure efficient AWS credits usage.
- **Monitor Migration Progress**: View and manage project milestones to ensure smooth resource usage.
- **Automate Tagging**: Use bulk tagging and AWS Systems Manager integration to fix missing tags and maintain resource compliance.

With the nOps platform, Solutions Providers can streamline MAP data management and maximize financial returns, making the complex process of managing multiple client migrations seamless and efficient. 

## How it Works & How to Get Started

### **Accessing the _Solution Provider Portal_**

Once you're added as an authorized user to the Solution Provider, a new menu section titled **"SOLUTION PROVIDER"** will appear in your nOps dashboard. You can access the Solution Provider Portal directly from this menu to view your consolidated client data.

Click on **“Solution Provider Portal”** under the SOLUTION PROVIDER section to manage and monitor your clients' data from one convenient dashboard.

**The AWS MAP Dashboard** in the **Solution Provider Portal** provides Solution Providers with a consolidated view of all active client projects under the **AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP)**. This centralized tool displays key information on spending, project progress, and AWS credits earned, helping providers efficiently manage and track clients’ MAP milestones.

### **Dashboard Overview**

The **AWS MAP Dashboard** allows Solution Providers to:

- Access a consolidated view of all clients’ AWS MAP data.

- Track spending across tagged and untagged resources.

- Monitor each project’s progress toward achieving AWS credits.

- Filter data by quarter and year for customized reporting.

### **Key Dashboard Sections**

The AWS MAP Dashboard is organized into two main sections:

1. **Current QTD (Quarter-to-Date) Summary**

2. **List of MAP Contracts**

#### **Current QTD Summary**

The **Current QTD Summary** section provides an at-a-glance overview of your clients’ AWS MAP performance. It includes five key data points:

- **Total Customers**: Only the clients with active AWS MAP projects.

- **Total Active Projects**: The number of AWS MAP projects currently running across all clients.

- **Total Tagged Spend**: The total amount spent on tagged resources across all projects.

- **Total Untagged Spend**: The total amount spent on untagged resources.

- **Overall Spending Target**: A progress bar showing how close all active projects are to reaching their target spend, after which AWS starts granting credits. Beneath the progress bar, you'll see how many projects have hit 100% of their spending target, unlocking AWS credits.

This section gives you a quick, high-level view of how close your clients are to receiving AWS credits, helping you to stay on top of their migration progress.

#### **List of MAP Contracts**

This section presents a detailed table for in-depth analysis of each client’s MAP projects. The following data points are available per client:

- **Client Name**: Displays the name of the client.

- **Total Projects**: Lists the number of active AWS MAP projects per client.

- **Tagged Spend**: Displays spending on resources that meet AWS tagging requirements.

- **Untagged Spend**: Lists spending on resources without the required tags.

- **Total Spending**: Consolidates all spending by the client for easy comparison.

Each client’s row can be expanded to reveal detailed project-level information, including:

- **Project Name**

- **Start Date** and **End Date**

- **Migration ID**

- **Total Spend** on the project

- **MAP Benefits Realized**: The amount of benefits the client has received after reaching the target spending.

- **Progress**: How close the project’s total spend is to the $50,000 target, after which AWS starts giving credits.

These detailed insights help Solution Providers keep track of individual projects and ensure that no AWS MAP opportunities are missed.

#### **Powerful Filtering Options**

The Dashboard includes a robust filtering tool to customize the data displayed. By selecting specific quarters and years, Solution Providers can:

- Focus on current or past periods for reporting and analysis.

- Generate customized reports that highlight client progress.

- Track spending patterns and tagging compliance over time.

The filtering feature simplifies data management, making it easier to generate timely reports and ensure efficient tracking of MAP credits across multiple clients.
